**Test code for Teensy 3.6**

This code is just me playing around with the Teensy 3.6 without using
Teensyduino.  It uses Eclipse with GNU GCC and the NXP SDK for the MK66.
Also, I use a J-Link EDU for debugging and code download instead of the
standard Teensy loader.

This may turn into something useful, but probably not.
